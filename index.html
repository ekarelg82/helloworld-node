  <p>What is the SQL verb to get information out of a database? Give an example of how you would read all the data in a table named 'transactions'</p>
  <P>SELECT, SELECT * FROM transactions;</p>
    <p>What is the SQL verb to change a value in a row?</p>
    <P>UPDATE</p>
      <p>Imagine there is a 'world' table with the following columns: country, continent, population, area, gdp, language. How would you change the 'language' of a country named countryx from Japanese to English?</p>
      <P>UDPATE world SET language='English' WHERE country='countryx'</p>
        <p>What is the SQL verb to add rows to a table?</p>
        <P>INSERT</p>
          <p>Consider the same table from question 3. Write a SQL statement which adds a country named 'Trumplandia' to this table. The country has the following data:</p>
          <P>INSERT INTO world(Country, Continent, Population, Area, GDP, Language) VALUES ('Trumplandia', 'America', '1', '1000000', '9999999999', 'Tremendous');</p>
            <p>Which is the SQL clause to filter results before the query is run?</p>
            <P>WHERE</p>
              <p>Consider the same table from question 3. Write a query which shows only the names of all countries with population lower than 10 million.</p>
              <P>SELECT countries FROM world WHERE population < 10000000 GROUP BY countries ORDER BY population DESC;</p>
